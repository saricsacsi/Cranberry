# Cranberry

notes:

  - the rate is 40000, it is only in publicsale and the privatsale we have a bonus tiers.
  - I set 2 wallets: cranberry_wallet and developer_wallet and we have a variable: amountForDev
 
  - ? do we need min/max contribution limit?
  - ? do we need max token what one address can buy?

  - maybe need some events more and "return true"? ( setwallet,..)
  - IMPORTANT to overview the roles ADMIN /OWNER
